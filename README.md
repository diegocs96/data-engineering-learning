# Data Engineering Learning Path 🚀

## About Me
Data Engineer with 4 years in enterprise environments (healthcare, banking).  
Currently upgrading my skills to industry-standard stack with a focus on **real-time geopolitical analytics and global supply chain intelligence**.

## Current Focus
- ✅ SQL mastery (LeetCode challenges)
- 🔄 Python fundamentals (Pandas, data manipulation)
- 📚 PySpark deep dive (Structured Streaming)
- ☁️ AWS Data Engineering certification prep
- 🌍 Real-time event processing (Kafka, Spark Streaming)

## Projects

### Production-Ready
- [SQL Challenges](./sql-challenges/) - LeetCode solutions with explanations

### Coming Soon: Geopolitical Data Intelligence Series 🌐
Building end-to-end pipelines that connect **world events → business impact**:

- **Maritime Risk Analytics**: Real-time conflict/weather impact on global shipping routes (GDELT + AIS data)
- **Commodity Supply Chain Monitors**: Tracking geopolitical events affecting critical materials (lithium, rare earths, oil...)
- **Trade Disruption Predictors**: Border closures, sanctions, and tariff impact on logistics flows
- **Infrastructure Resilience Dashboards**: Energy pipelines, sea lanes, and cross-border trade under geopolitical stress

**Tech Stack for Series:**  
`Spark Streaming` `Docker` `Kubernetes` `Airflow` `Public APIs (GDELT, AIS, Weather, Commodities)` `Delta Lake` `Terraform`

**Why this matters:**  
Modern supply chains need visibility into geopolitical risks *before* they become headlines. These projects simulate real-world scenarios where data engineering drives strategic business decisions.

## Stack
**Currently working with:** SQL, Python, Spark, AWS (S3, EMR, Glue), Airflow  
**Learning:** PySpark Structured Streaming, dbt, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
**Exploring:** Kafka, Prometheus/Grafana, MLflow
